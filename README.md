# InventoryManager

The Inventory App would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app stores information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It also allows the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

This project combines various ideas and skills. They include:

1. Storing information in a SQLite database
2. Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
3. Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
4. Updating information based on user input.
5. Creating intents to other apps using stored information.
